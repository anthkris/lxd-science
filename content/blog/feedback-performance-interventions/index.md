description: "The identification of a number of moderators suggests that in certain situations, feedback interventions (FIs) can yield a large and positive effect on performance. Specifically, a feedback intervention provided for a familiar task, containing cues that support learning, attracting attention to feedback-standard discrepancies at the task level (velocity FI and goal setting), and is void of cues to the metatask level (e.g., cues that direct attention to the self) is likely to yield impressive gains in performance."
