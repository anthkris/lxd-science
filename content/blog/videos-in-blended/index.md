description: Video content benefits instructors and learners alike in many ways. Through dynamic visualizations and actual objects, actions, and scenes, learners can absorb more information than is possible from a text. Videos also motivate learners by providing more opportunities for interactivity. Live, two-way video-based communications greatly improve instructor-learner connections, providing a more personalized experience and helping instructors understand a learner’s reactions and emotions, enabling them to adjust the pace of a live lesson or add clarification as needed. Training outcomes are improved and learners feel more empowered if they have full control over their video, including the ability to pause, replay and skip through content. Pitfalls of using video in blended learning include technical challenges, extra time required (to create recorded videos and host live interactive sessions), camera shyness and risks to learner privacy. To improve effectiveness, videos should have the capacity for evaluation and timely adjustment to accommodate learner feedback and update content.
