description: The results show that learners’ engagement with the content, exercises and mentoring of a blended learning environment, final academic performance could be predicted when only one-third of the course had elapsed. Furthermore, the blended data set combining online and traditional critical factors (including face-to-face mentoring after class) resulted in the best learner performance.
