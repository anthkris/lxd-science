description: In two experiments, 216 college students learned to solve one kind of mathematics problem beforecompleting one of various practise schedules. In Experiment 1, students either massed 10 problems ina single session or distributed these 10 problems across two sessions separated by 1 week. The benefitof distributed practise was nil among students who were tested 1 week later but extremely largeamong students tested 4 weeks later. In Experiment 2, students completed three or nine practiseproblems in one session. The additional six problems constituted a strategy known as overlearning,but this extra effort had no effect on test scores 1 or 4 weeks later. Thus, long-term retention was boosted by distributed practise and unaffected by overlearning. Unfortunately, most mathematicstextbooks rely on a format that emphasises overlearning and minimises distributed practise. An easilyadopted alternative format is advocated.
